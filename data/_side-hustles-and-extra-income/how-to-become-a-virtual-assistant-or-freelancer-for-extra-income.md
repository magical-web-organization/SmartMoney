## Determine Your Rates

When determining your rates as a virtual assistant or freelancer, consider your skills, experience, and the value you bring to your clients. Research what other freelancers in your niche charge and use that as a benchmark. Determine your hourly rate or project rate and make sure it aligns with your industry and level of experience.
