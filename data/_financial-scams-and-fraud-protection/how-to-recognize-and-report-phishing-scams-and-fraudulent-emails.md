1. Do not reply to the email or click on any links or attachments.
2. Forward the email to the organization or company that the scammer is pretending to be.
3. Report the scam to the appropriate authorities, such as the Federal Trade Commission or Internet Crime Complaint Center.
4. If you have provided confidential information, contact your bank or financial institution immediately.

## Protecting Yourself Against Phishing Scams
Here are some tips to help protect you against phishing scams:

1. Keep your computer and anti-virus software up to date.
