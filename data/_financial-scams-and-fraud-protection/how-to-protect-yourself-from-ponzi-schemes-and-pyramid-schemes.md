Pyramid and Ponzi schemes have been around for decades and have preyed on many unsuspecting victims. These financial frauds promise high returns on investment, but the only ones who get rich are the schemers themselves. Here are some tips on how to protect yourself from Ponzi and pyramid schemes.

## What is a Ponzi Scheme?

A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment scam where returns are paid to earlier investors using the capital of newer investors. The returns are not generated by a legitimate business investment but are instead paid using newly invested funds. The scheme eventually collapses when the pool of new investors dries up or when too many investors try to cash out at once.

## What is a Pyramid Scheme?

A pyramid scheme operates similarly to a Ponzi scheme but relies on recruiting new investors to pay returns to earlier investors. Pyramid schemes often take the form of "multi-level marketing" programs, where participants are promised commissions for recruiting others into the scheme. Participants in pyramid schemes often lose their entire investment when the scheme inevitably collapses.

## Tips on How to Protect Yourself

### Do Your Research

Before investing in anything, do your research. Check with the SEC or your state securities regulator to see if the investment is registered, and look for unbiased reviews and testimonials from other investors. If the investment promoter claims that it is exempt from securities registration, that is a red flag. Don't be afraid to ask questions, and be especially cautious of investments that come with high-pressure sales tactics.

### Avoid Guarantees and Unrealistic Returns

If an investment promises guaranteed returns or unsustainably high returns, it is likely too good to be true. Be wary of any investment that claims to have no risk or that says that you cannot lose money. Every investment carries some degree of risk, and high returns often mean high risk.

### Be Cautious of Pyramid Schemes Disguised as Multi-Level Marketing

Multi-level marketing programs can be legitimate, but they can also be used as a cover for a pyramid scheme. If the focus of the program is on recruiting new investors rather than selling a legitimate product or service, it may be a pyramid scheme. Be especially cautious if you are asked to invest a large sum of money up front.

### Be Wary of Friends and Family Members Promoting Investments

Investments should be based on their merit rather than the relationship of the person promoting them. Even if the investment opportunity comes from a friend or family member, do your research before making any investment decisions.

### Trust Your Instincts

If something seems too good to be true or if you feel uncomfortable with an investment opportunity, trust your instincts and walk away. It's better to miss out on a potential opportunity than to lose your hard-earned money in a fraudulent scheme.

By following these tips, you can protect yourself from Ponzi and pyramid schemes. Remember, the best defense is to educate yourself and to remain skeptical of any investment that seems too good to be true.
