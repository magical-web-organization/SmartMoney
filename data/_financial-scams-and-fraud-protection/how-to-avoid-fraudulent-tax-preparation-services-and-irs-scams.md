Tax time can be a stressful period for most people. It can be confusing to navigate the maze of regulations and tax laws. Unfortunately, there are individuals and organizations that prey on taxpayers' anxieties and confusion. Scammers can pose as tax preparers or IRS agents to try to steal your personal information or money. Here are some tips on how to avoid fraudulent tax preparation services and IRS scams.

## Tips for Avoiding Fraudulent Tax Preparation Services

1. **Choose your tax preparer carefully** – Make sure the tax preparer you choose is reputable and has a good track record. Do your research before selecting a tax preparer. Check their references, reviews, and ask for referrals from trusted sources.

2. **Avoid exaggerated promises ** – Be wary of tax preparers who make exaggerated promises or guarantees of large refunds. No tax preparer can guarantee a refund or a specific amount of money.

3. **Check your tax returns thoroughly** – Review your tax returns with a critical eye. Make sure the information is accurate, complete, and reflects your true financial situation.

4. **Question fee arrangements** – Make sure you understand how the tax preparer charges for their services. Avoid tax preparers that charge you a percentage of your refund.

5. **Avoid giving personal information on the phone** – Be careful when giving personal information over the phone. Scammers may pose as IRS agents to try and get your personal information.

## Tips for Avoiding IRS Scams

1 .**Beware of IRS impersonators** – Scammers may pose as IRS agents and threaten you with arrest or legal action if you don't pay them immediately. Remember, the IRS will never call you demanding payment.

2. **Verify who is calling** – If someone claiming to be from the IRS calls you, ask for their name and badge number. Hang up and verify their identity by calling the IRS directly.

3. **Don't click on suspicious links** – Be cautious of email phishing scams that claim to be from the IRS. The IRS will not send you an email claiming you owe money.

4. **Avoid unsecured websites** – Be careful when visiting tax preparation websites. Make sure the website has a secure connection and a padlock icon in the address bar.

5. **Protect your personal information** – Don't share your personal information online or over the phone unless you know the recipient's identity and the purpose of the information.

In summary, it is essential to be cautious when dealing with tax preparation services and the IRS. Scammers can pose as legitimate tax preparers or IRS agents to try to steal your personal information or money. Be vigilant and use these tips to protect yourself from fraudulent tax preparation services and IRS scams.
