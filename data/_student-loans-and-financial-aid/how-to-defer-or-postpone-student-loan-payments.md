As a student, there may be times when you experience financial difficulty and cannot repay your student loans. Fortunately, there are options available to help you defer or postpone your loan payments. Here are some ways that you can avoid defaulting on your student loans.

## Deferment

Deferment is a way to temporarily pause your student loan payments. During a deferment period, interest will still accrue on your loan but you typically will not be required to make any payments. To qualify for deferment, you must meet certain requirements such as:

- Enrolled in school at least half-time
- Unemployed or experiencing economic hardship
- In active military service
- In a rehabilitation training program

To apply for deferment, contact your loan servicer and fill out the necessary paperwork.

## Forbearance

Forbearance is another option to temporarily reduce or postpone your student loan payments. During forbearance, interest will continue to accrue on your loan, and you may be required to make payments on the interest. To qualify for forbearance, you must meet certain requirements such as:

- Experiencing financial difficulty
- In a medical/dental internship or residency
- Serving in a national service position

To apply for forbearance, contact your loan servicer and fill out the necessary paperwork.

## Income-Driven Repayment Plans

Income-driven repayment plans are designed to help students who are struggling to repay their loans. These plans consider your income and family size and can lower your monthly payments. Some of the income-driven repayment plans include:

- Income-Based Repayment (IBR)
- Pay As You Earn (PAYE)
- Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)
- Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)

You can apply for an income-driven repayment plan through your loan servicer.

## Conclusion

Deferment, forbearance, and income-driven repayment plans are all useful options for students who are struggling to meet their loan payments. If you are experiencing financial difficulty or any other difficulty that makes it impossible to pay your student loans as scheduled, contact your loan servicer for guidance on the options available to you.
