## What is Peer-to-Peer Lending?

Peer-to-peer lending is a type of lending that bypasses traditional financial institutions like banks. Instead, it uses online platforms that connect borrowers with investors. Borrowers apply for loans online and investors can choose to fund the loans that match their preferences.
