Many Americans rely on Social Security benefits as a major source of income during their retirement. However, not everyone is aware of the steps they can take to maximize their Social Security benefits. Following are a few steps that you can take to get the most of your Social Security benefits during retirement:

## Delay the initiation of Social Security Benefits

Social Security benefits can be claimed as early as 62. However, by doing so, you lose a significant amount of your lifetime benefit amount. Therefore, it is recommended to wait for as long as possible before claiming benefits. The longer you wait, the more benefit amount you can accrue. Your benefits increase by around 8% for each year after the full retirement age (FRA), until age 70.

## Work and pay Social Security taxes for at least 35 years

Social Security calculates your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) based on your 35 highest earning years. The more years you contribute to the Social Security system, the greater your benefits. Therefore, it is recommended to work for at least 35 years to maximize your Social Security benefits. If you havenâ€™t worked for at least 35 years, some of the years with fewer earnings can be replaced by $0 earnings when calculating your benefit amount.

## Understand spousal benefits

Married couples may qualify for spousal benefits. These benefits are equal to 50% of the benefits earned by the higher-earning spouse. A lower-earning spouse who has not worked outside the home can claim spousal benefits based on the work history of their higher-earning spouse. Therefore, it is recommended to explore how spousal benefits can increase your overall benefit amounts.

## Minimize taxes on Social Security benefits

Social Security benefits may be taxable, depending on your income level. The higher your income level, the more taxes you will pay on your Social Security benefits. Therefore, it is recommended to adjust your income level to minimize the taxes on your Social Security benefits. You can do this by considering a Roth IRA conversion or delaying the initiation of your traditional IRA or 401(k) withdrawals.

## Conclusion

Social Security benefits can be a crucial source of income during retirement. By following the above steps, you can maximize your Social Security benefits and secure a better future.
