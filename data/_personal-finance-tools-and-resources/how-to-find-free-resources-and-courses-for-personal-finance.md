However, the good news is that there are many free resources and courses available online which can be used to gain knowledge and expertise in personal finance. This article will guide you through how to find free resources and courses to effectively manage your personal finances.

Google, Bing, and other search engines can be your best friend when looking for free resources and courses. Simply type in key phrases such as "free personal finance courses" or "free financial advice" into the search engine and browse through the results.

## Check out government websites

The government offers various resources for personal finance, and they are entirely free of charge. Check out websites such as the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) consumer.gov or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) consumerfinance.gov for free financial education resources.

## Visit finance blogs and websites
