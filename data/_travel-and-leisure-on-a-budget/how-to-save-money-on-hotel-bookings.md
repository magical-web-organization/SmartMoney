Whether you are travelling for business, leisure, or anything in between, hotel bookings can be a big expense. But with a little bit of effort and planning, you can save money and ensure you get the best deal possible. Here are some tips and tricks to help you save money on hotel bookings:

## 1. Book in advance

One of the easiest ways to save money on hotel bookings is to book in advance. Many hotels offer early bird discounts and booking in advance can save you between 10% and 40%. Not only do you save money, but you also have a bigger selection of rooms to choose from. So, if you know your travel dates well in advance, make sure to book your hotel as soon as possible.

## 2. Be flexible with your travel dates

If you are flexible with your travel dates, you can save even more. Many hotels offer discounts for mid-week stays or for stays during their off-season. So, if you are not tied to specific travel dates, check out different dates to see if you can get a better deal. Apps like Hotel Tonight or Booking.com can give you real-time rates for the dates you choose.

## 3. Use booking websites

Booking travel accommodation through booking websites can give you access to discounted rates that are not available through the hotel directly. Websites like Expedia, Hotels.com, and Booking.com offer exclusive deals and packages that can help you save money on your hotel bookings. It is also worth to note that some of these websites offer loyalty programs that translate into cash rebates or even free stays.

## 4. Use hotel loyalty programs

Many hotels offer loyalty programs that reward frequent guests with discounts and other perks. Some of these programs are free to join and offer benefits such as early check-in, late check-out, free Wi-Fi, and free breakfast. It is important to compare and choose the best program based on your needs, destination and preferred hotel chains.

## 5. Consider alternative accommodations

If hotels are too expensive or not your thing, consider alternative accommodations like vacation rentals or hostels. Vacation rentals like Airbnb, VRBO, and HomeAway often offer lower rates and can be a more authentic way to experience the local culture. Hostels offer budget-friendly options for solo travellers, backpackers, or anyone looking to meet new people.

Saving money on hotel bookings requires some effort and planning, but it is definitely possible. By using these tips, you can get the best deal possible and save your money to spend on other parts of your trip.
