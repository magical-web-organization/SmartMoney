As we age or face unexpected situations, it's important to have a trusted person who can make decisions for our finances, healthcare or legal matters when we are unable to do so ourselves. This is where a power of attorney (POA) comes in. A power of attorney is a legal document that grants a designated person the authority to act on behalf of another person.

There are several types of power of attorney, and knowing which one to use can save you and your loved ones time, money, and stress. Let's discuss the different types of POA and how to designate them.

## General Power of Attorney

A general power of attorney grants someone the authority to act on behalf of the person who created it (the Principal) for a variety of legal, financial, and business matters. It can be broad or specific in terms of the powers granted. A general POA usually ends when the Principal becomes incapacitated or dies.

To designate a general power of attorney, the Principal must be of sound mind and sign the document in the presence of a notary public. It's important to choose someone trustworthy and capable of handling your affairs.

## Limited Power of Attorney

A limited power of attorney grants someone the authority to act on behalf of the Principal for a specific purpose or for a limited time. For example, a person might want to grant someone the authority to handle their financial affairs while they are out of the country.

To designate a limited power of attorney, the Principal must specify the scope and duration of the power of attorney in the legal document. Like a general POA, it must also be signed in the presence of a notary public.

## Durable Power of Attorney

A durable power of attorney grants someone the same powers as a general POA, but it remains in effect if the Principal becomes incapacitated. It's important to have a durable POA in place before an unforeseen accident or illness occurs.

To designate a durable power of attorney, the Principal must specifically state that they want the power of attorney to remain valid even if they become incapacitated. Like a general POA, it must also be signed in the presence of a notary public and witnesses.

## Healthcare Power of Attorney

A healthcare power of attorney allows someone to make decisions about the Principal's medical care if they become incapacitated or unable to communicate. This type of POA is also known as a medical power of attorney.

To designate a healthcare power of attorney, the Principal must be of sound mind and indicate their wishes in a legal document. They must also choose a trusted person to make decisions about their medical treatment in their absence.

## Financial Power of Attorney

A financial power of attorney grants someone the authority to make financial decisions on behalf of the Principal, such as managing bank accounts, paying bills, or filing tax returns. This type of POA can be general or limited in scope.

To designate a financial power of attorney, the Principal must be of sound mind and sign a legal document in the presence of a notary public. They must also choose someone trustworthy and capable of handling their financial affairs.

In conclusion, there are different types of power of attorney and each one serves a different purpose. It's important to understand the differences to make informed decisions for yourself or your loved ones. Remember, it's never too early to start planning for the unexpected.
