Trusts are versatile estate planning documents that can help protect your assets and provide for your beneficiaries. There are different types of trusts, each with its own unique features and benefits. In this article, we will explore the different types of trusts and guide you on how to set them up.

## Types of Trusts

Below are some of the different types of trusts:

### Revocable Living Trust

A revocable living trust is a popular estate planning tool that allows you to retain control over your assets while you are alive. You can modify, amend or revoke this type of trust during your lifetime. The trust will become irrevocable upon your death.

### Irrevocable Trust

An irrevocable trust is a trust that cannot be altered or revoked once it is created, without the consent of the beneficiaries or a court of law. This type of trust can help you protect your assets from creditors or lawsuits.

### Asset Protection Trust

An asset protection trust is a type of irrevocable trust designed to protect your assets from potential creditors. This type of trust is often used by individuals who are in high-risk professions or who face significant legal liabilities.

### Charitable Trust

A charitable trust is a type of trust that allows you to support a charitable cause or organization. You can receive significant tax benefits by creating this type of trust.

### Special Needs Trust

A special needs trust is a type of trust designed to provide for the needs of individuals with disabilities. This type of trust can help ensure that your loved one with special needs receives the care and support they need, without affecting their eligibility for government benefits.
