Estate planning isn’t just about transferring property and wealth to loved ones. It’s also an opportunity to support charitable causes that are important to you. Planning ahead for charitable giving in your estate plan can benefit both the charities you care about and your legacy. Here are some options for charitable giving to consider:

## Bequests

One of the simplest ways to give to charity in your estate plan is through a bequest. A bequest is a provision in your will that directs a certain amount or percentage of your estate to a charitable organization of your choice. This is an easy way to ensure that your charitable goals are met after you pass away.

## Charitable Gift Annuities

Charitable gift annuities are an agreement between you and a charitable organization in which you make a donation to the charity and they, in turn, provide you with a regular income stream for the remainder of your life. This is a great option for those who want to support a charity while also ensuring they have a steady income in retirement.

## Charitable Remainder Trusts

Charitable remainder trusts (CRTs) are another option for those who want to support a charity while still receiving an income during their lifetime. With a CRT, you transfer assets to a trust and receive income from that trust during your lifetime. When you pass away, the remainder of the assets in the trust are then donated to the charity of your choice.

## Charitable Lead Trusts

Charitable lead trusts are the opposite of CRTs. With a lead trust, the charity receives income from the trust for a set period of time, and then the remainder of the assets in the trust are passed on to your beneficiaries. This can be a good option for those who want to support a charity during their lifetime, but still want to leave assets to their heirs.

## Donor-Advised Funds

Donor-advised funds are philanthropic vehicles that allow you to make a charitable contribution and receive an immediate tax deduction. The funds are then held in a dedicated account and you can make recommendations on how to distribute the funds to the charities of your choice.

## Private Foundations

Private foundations are charitable organizations that are funded by a single individual or family. They allow you to have more control over where your charitable donations go and can provide significant tax benefits.


In conclusion, there are several ways to incorporate charitable giving into your estate plan. Whether you choose a bequest, charitable gift annuity, CRT, lead trust, donor-advised fund, or private foundation, charitable giving can be a meaningful way to give back to causes you care about while also providing financial benefits to your estate. Consult with your estate planning professional to determine which option is best for you and your legacy.
