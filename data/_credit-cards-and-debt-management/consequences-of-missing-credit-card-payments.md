---
Having a credit card can be incredibly convenient when it comes to making purchases and building up your credit score. However, missing payments on your credit card can quickly turn a helpful tool into a financial burden. In this article, we will go over the consequences of missing credit card payments and what steps you can take to avoid them.

## Late Payment Fees

One of the immediate consequences of missing credit card payments is the late payment fee that your credit card company may charge you. This fee can range from $29 to $39, depending on your credit card company and the amount of your missed payment. These fees may seem minor, but they can add up quickly if you consistently miss payments.

## Interest Charges

In addition to late payment fees, you will also have to pay interest charges on any unpaid balances. Interest rates on credit cards can be as high as 25%, which means you will be paying a significant amount in interest charges if you consistently miss payments. Your interest charges will accrue daily, which means that the longer you wait to make your payment, the more you will owe in interest.

## Damage to Your Credit Score

One of the most significant consequences of missing credit card payments is the damage it can do to your credit score. Payment history makes up 35% of your FICO credit score, which means that consistently missing payments can cause your score to drop significantly. A lower credit score can make it harder to qualify for loans or credit cards in the future, and may even result in higher interest rates when you do qualify.

## Collection Calls and Debt Collection

If you continue to miss your credit card payments, your credit card company may send your account to a debt collection agency. These agencies can make repeated calls to your home or workplace, and may even take legal action to collect the debt. Additionally, having an account sent to collections can stay on your credit report for up to seven years, which will impact your credit score and make it harder to get approved for future credit.

## How to Avoid Missing Credit Card Payments

The best way to avoid the consequences of missing credit card payments is to make your payments on time and in full each month. Here are some tips to help you do that:

- Set up automatic payments: Many credit card companies offer the option to set up automatic payments, which can help ensure that you never miss a payment.
- Create a budget: Knowing how much money you have coming in and going out each month can help you plan your credit card payments and avoid overspending.
- Use credit responsibly: Only use your credit card for purchases you can afford and keep your balances low to avoid getting into debt.

In conclusion, missing credit card payments can have serious consequences, both in terms of your finances and your credit score. By making your payments on time and in full each month, you can avoid these consequences and maintain a healthy financial life.
