Credit cards can be very convenient, but they can also be very expensive. If you're carrying a balance on your credit cards, you're probably paying a lot in interest every month. One way to reduce your interest rates and save money is to negotiate with your credit card companies. Here are some tips on how to negotiate with credit card companies to reduce your interest rates.

## Do Your Research
Before you call your credit card companies, do some research. Check what interest rates other credit cards are offering, and use this information to negotiate a better rate. You can also check your current credit score, as a better score can qualify you for a lower interest rate.

## Be Prepared
When you call your credit card companies, be prepared with your account information, such as your account number and balance. You should also be prepared with your research on other interest rates and your credit score. This shows that you're serious about wanting a better rate and that you've done your homework.

## Stay Calm and Polite
When you're negotiating with credit card companies, it's important to stay calm and polite. Yelling or becoming angry will not help your case, and may result in the representative being less willing to work with you. Remember, the representative you're speaking with is just doing their job, and is not personally responsible for your interest rate.

## Explain Your Situation
When negotiating with credit card companies, explain your situation. If you're struggling to make payments, tell them that you need a lower interest rate in order to make your payments more manageable. If you've been a long-time customer, remind them of your loyalty and ask if there are any loyalty discounts or programs that you may be eligible for.

## Ask for a Lower Rate
Finally, ask for a lower rate. Be specific about the rate you're looking for, based on your research. If the representative cannot meet your request, ask if there are any other options available, such as a temporary interest rate reduction or a payment plan.

Negotiating with credit card companies can be intimidating, but it's worth the effort if it saves you money in the long run. Remember to do your research, be prepared, stay calm and polite, explain your situation, and ask for a lower rate. With these tips, you can successfully negotiate with your credit card companies to reduce your interest rates.
