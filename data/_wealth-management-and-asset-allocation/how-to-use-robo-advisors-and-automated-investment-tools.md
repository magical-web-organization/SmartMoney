These modern alternatives to traditional financial advisors have been gaining popularity in recent years, thanks to their ability to help individuals manage their finances more efficiently and effectively.

But how do you use these tools, especially if you're just starting out? Here are some tips for getting started with robo-advisors and other automated investment tools.

## Understand Your Investment Style and Goals

Before you begin investing with robo-advisors or other automated tools, it's important to understand your investment style and goals. This includes knowing how much risk you're willing to take and what kind of returns you're looking for. Essentially, you need to know about your risk tolerance level.

If you're unsure about these factors, consider taking a risk assessment quiz or speaking with a financial advisor to help you determine your preferences. Once you have a better understanding of your needs and preferences, you can select a robo-advisor or automated tool that suits your needs.

## Choose the Right Platform

There are many different robo-advisors and automated investment tools available on the market today, each with its own unique features and benefits. Some popular examples include Betterment, Wealthfront, and Ellevest.

To choose the right platform, consider factors such as fees, account minimums, investment options, and customer support. You may also want to try out a few different platforms to see which one you feel most comfortable using.

## Set and Monitor Your Investments

Once you've selected your robo-advisor or automated tool, it's time to set up your investments. This may involve selecting a portfolio or creating a custom investment plan based on your goals and preferences. Be sure to diversify your investments by investing in a range of different assets, such as stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

Once your investments are set up, it's important to monitor them regularly to ensure they're meeting your goals. This may involve rebalancing your portfolio or making adjustments based on market conditions or changes to your goals.

## Conclusion

Robo-advisors and other automated investment tools can be a powerful tool for managing your finances, but it's important to understand how to use them effectively. By following these tips and doing your research, you can maximize your returns while minimizing risks and achieving your financial goals.
